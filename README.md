# Leaflet_Challenge_VL

Challenge features a two layer map created with a Leaflet d3 library. 
Map shows earthquake locations marked with circles proportional to the magnitude and colors reflecting the depth of each earthquake. 
Included legend explains the earthquake depth color scheme.
Data used for the challenge is sourced from the USGS API from the past 30-day significnat Earthquake dataset.
